    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    
    <p>Backtracking is the form of recursion</p>
    <br>
    <P>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of the option; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state; If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if<br> you didn't,it isn't.</P>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably ha soe goo leaves and some bad leaves. though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,beginning with the root, you choos one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose  you get to a bad leaf. You can Backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another chice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, thre are no good leaves to be found.</p>
<br>
This needs an example.

<ol>
    <li>Starting at Root. your options are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
    <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
    <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
    <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
    <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
    <li>At A, you have no options left to try Go back to Root.</li><br>
    <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
    <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
    <li>E is good. congratulations!</li><br>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <hr>
    <font size="4" color="green">
    <pre>boolean solve(Node n){
           if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }else{
           for each child c of n {
             if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }<br>
           return false
          }
     }</pre></font><hr>
     <h3>How does this work?</h3>
     <ul> 
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li><br>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. in the above code, this is done by lines</p>
<hr>
 <font size="4" color="green">
<pre> 
    for each child c of n {
     if solve{c} succeeds, return true
    }
    return false 
</pre></font>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal
node. If is not solvable. This is our case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
<hr>
 <font size="4" color="green">
<pre>
    if n is a leaf node{
        if the leaf is a goal node return true
        else return false
    }
</pre></font>
<hr>
<br>
<p>The backtrcking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
<br>
<ul type="square"><li><h3>To search a tree:</h3></li></ul>
<br>
<ol><li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li><br>
<li> Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have<br>searched them all unsuccessfully.</li></ol>
<br>
<h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>

<p>Backtracking is a rather tyoical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorith. In fact, that is now your recursive algorithm are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
   <hr>
    <font size="4" color="green">
   <pre>
    boolean solve(Node n){
     put node n on the stack;
      while the stack is not empty{
       if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
          if it is a goal node, return true
           else pop it off the stack
       }
       else{
        if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
            push the next untried child onto the stack 
          else pop the nodeoff the stack

       }
       return false
    }
   </pre></font>
   <hr>
   <p>
    Starting for the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the 
    stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at alll tht times describe a valid path in the
   tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,
   if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty) there must have been no goal nodes at all and no solution to the false.
</p>
<h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
<p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorith are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p>
<P>
    To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be found in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writting a <b>gameOver method</b> for you could even call it <b>isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possibe moves remain.<br>
</P>
<p>
    Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already(so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made tihs look simple, by just saying<b> for each child c of n.</b> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be n obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangenent of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've alreay examined?
</p>
<p>There is an easier way keep track with children have been tired, if you can define and odering of on the children if there is an odering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determind which child to try next.</p><br>
<h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
<p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible exaample of bractracking . which is serching an actual tree. We wil so use the simplest kinnd of tree, a binary tree.</p>
<p> A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Eachnode can reference(pointt to) zero, one, or two other nodes, whch are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable(by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles, For our purpose, although this is nto part of the definition of a binary tre, we wil say that a node might our might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The firsdt example in this paper (which we repeat here)  shows a binary tree.</p>
<p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:</p>
<hr>
<font color="green" size="4"> <pre>
    public class Binary Tree {
        BinaryTree leftChild = null;
        BinaryTree rightChild = null;
        boolean isGoalNode = false;
        String name;

       BinaryTree(String name, Binary Tree right, boolean is GoalNode){
        this.name = name;
        leftChild = left;
        rightChild = right;
        this.isGoalNode;
       }
      } 
</pre></font>
<hr>
<p>Next we wil create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree{} which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
<hr>
<font size="4" color="green">
<pre>static Binary Tree makeTree(){
    BinaryTree root, a,b,c,d,e,f;
    c= new Binary Tree("C, null, null, false);
    d= new BinaryTree("D",null, null, false);
    e= new BinaryTree("E",null, null, false);
    f= new BinaryTree("F",null, null, false);
    a= new BinaryTree("A",null, null, false);
    b= new BinaryTree("B",e,f,false);
    root= new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
    root = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
    return root;
}

</pre></font>
<hr>
<p>And finallhy, here's thee recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
<hr>
<font size="4" color="green">
    <pre>
        static boolean solvabkle(BinaryTree node){
        /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
        /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
        /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
        /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
        /*5*/ return false;
        }
    </pre>
</font>
<hr>
I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficienrt.

 <h3>
    What are the children?</h3>
    <p>
    One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the precious choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solution. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately. without recursion.

    </p>
    <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four=coloring a map. it is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matterhow cobvoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that sharea border are the same color.</p>
    <p>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries arer colored.</p>
    <br>
    <p> There are two ways to do this;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible color, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether youare at a goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run our of countries. you have succesfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
        <p> Let's apply each of these two methods to problem of coloring a checkerbboard. This should be easily solvable; afteer all, a checkerboard only needs tow color.
        
        </p>
        <h4>boolean maplesOK()</h4>
   <p> Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p>
   <h4>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h4>
   <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the give color.</p>
   <h4>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</h4>
   <p>
    Used by both mehtods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <hr>
    <font size="4" color="green">
   <pre>
    boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color){
     if (row>=NUM_ROWS)return mapisOK();
     map{row}[column]=color;
     for(int nextColor= RED; nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
     if(explore1(next[0],next[1]),nextColor))return true;
    }
    return false;
    }
</pre></font>
<hr>
<p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests oteerwise:</p>
<table border="1" align="center" cellpading="2">
  <thead>
    <th></th>
    <th bgcolor="grey">2 by 3 map</th>
    <th bgcolor="grey">3 by 3 map</th>
    <th bgcolor="grey">3 by 4 map</th>
  </thead>

        <td>0 ms.</td>

    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
<p>The zeros in th above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of the zeros in the above tablke indicate times too short measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference ? Either of these methods could have exponentisl gorwth;  Eliminating  a node automiticlly eliminates all of itws descenates all of its descendents, nand this will ofte prevent exponential growth. if there is any way to eliminate cikldredn (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

    <p> Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse orderl; it is up to you, the programmer, to reversde the result again to get them in the correct order.</p>
